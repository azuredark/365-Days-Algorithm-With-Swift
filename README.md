# 365 days with Swift

The <a href="https://github.com/devmehmetates/365-day-of-code">work</a> I did last year added a lot to me and enabled me to get a job. Now I want to continue to improve myself and focus on solving some more problems. I think this will be an incredible improvement in both my Swift and engineering skills.

## What's plan?
- Very simple. Solve **only** 1 challenge per day (hackerrank, leet code etc.).
- Don't force yourself, just go with the flow. You've worked hard and you have to take it slow.
- Go from easy to hard. Start very simple. Go make it harder. If it gets difficult :)

## Okay, Do you have some rules? Yes! 
- Never, ever solve more than 1 challenge per day.
- Solving it may not be enough. Solve first, then fix your code.
- When you say OK, look at other codes.

That's all! Don't forget to be a good developer and help people ðŸ™‚
